PUBG is a tactical competitive shooting game developed by Bluehole Ginno Games. In this game, players need to collect various resources in the arena and fight against other players in a shrinking safe area to survive to the end. As the game starts, the aircraft will travel from different directions on the island, and players can freely choose where they want to go. Players can parachute to every corners of the map, find weapons, vehicles and supplies with bare hands, and start battles in different terrains. They can either choose to land at military base which has abundant resources, or in a sparsely populated and resource-poor wilderness. During the game, there will be a blue circle expelling the player to a smaller place to battle. In each round of the game, the safe zone will generate randomly, and the weapons and props in each area also appear randomly. The modeling of every scene on the map is extremely real, such as small towns, residential areas, military bases and air-raid shelters, even the weapons are extremely real.

In the game, each player can carry 4 kinds of weapons, one melee weapon (such as sickle, pan, etc.), two long-range firearms (rifle, machine gun, sniper rifle, shotgun, submachine gun), one pistol, and some throwing weapon like grenades, smoke grenades, flash grenades, but during combat, only one of them can be used at a time.

The game made many weapons that players can choose, each player will have their favorite weapons. The first time I play with HTML, CSS and js, I decided to make a web page to list the most popular weapons that players like to use in the game. This web page list out two categories of weapon, rifles and sniper rifles. Also, the list includes the top three most popular rifles and sniper rifles. In the top three list, it marks down the ammo type and the capacity for each weapon. In addition, at the bottom of this web page, it provides a link leads you to another web page that has more detail about all weapons.
