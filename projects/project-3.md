My professor introduce java to me during high school, and this the one of the project I made during that period. This project is a money calculator, users can interact with it by following instructions it provides. The calculator calculates the number of each denominations of money that need to return to customer. For example, if you input enter $450 for the price, and $1000 for payment, it will display one "$500" and  one "$50". This calculator only display New Taiwan dollar as the main currency, but it can be improved by adding more currency of different contries.
