I always wanted to learn this course, because I think know how to write code is a very cool thing, and it is the thing that only those masters with the title of engineer can play with. After before I got exposed to some programming language, I finally got a general idea of creating a program. I always felt abstract, confused and loss when I was learning, but it's not very difficult to understand.

Before, I thought that software development is actually a very easy and happy thing before. I only need to sit in front of the computer and type on the keyboard for all day. But I realize how superficial and ridiculous my previous thoughts were. Programming is actually a creative activity where fun and distress coexist. Because programming not only satisfies our desire of create, but also delights our inner emotions when you successfully made some progress.

During these two weeks experiencing software engineering course, I felt that those practice WODs actually improved the way I think. I wasn't able to write the code in an efficient way, sometimes I made it more complicate. But after watching professor wrote the code using his method, I learned how to think faster. I'm looking forward to learn more programming skills and create some projects with my group.
