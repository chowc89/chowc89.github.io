How to ask questions is a skill that people should learn to have. Good questions can provoke thoughts and drive execution. Sometimes, the question is more important than the answer. Some questions make people particularly want to answer. When answering these questions, not only can they quickly sort out the answers, but also help people realize some information that they never pay attention to. To the people who are good at computers, the answers to the questions you get depend on the method and difficulty of the question. Computer masters like good questions that are challenging and deep. If you give them an interesting topic, they will respond enthusiastically to your question.

To me, there are only two kinds of questions that are positive and meaningful: one is to promote the joint work of both parties; the other is to obtain answer information. The first type of questioning is to promote the joint work of both sides, then the standing position is that the two sides are side by side. The purpose of asking questions is to discover and explore the resources of both parties in one matter. The standard of a good question is to present a deeper, more novel, and more comprehensive resource in the form of an answer. For example, “[Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)” 
is a good question. The question clearly explains the situation and marks down the difference the person has noticed which is great because people can provide a more direct answer to his question. There is another kind of questioning to obtain answers and information. At this time, the questioner is here to ask for advice. For example, “[How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git)” The questioner wants to get the solution from others. In this case to the questioner, the person who answers the question is the resource. The question is the key to the door of the resource which is the goal of the questioner.

Of course, there are also many counterexamples. In many cases, the questioner will raise a question that is inexplicable, unclear and multiple ambiguities.  For example, in this question “[Country specific emergency numbers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53600902/country-specific-emergency-numbers)” The questioner did not specify the situation that he is facing. At this point, if the person who answers is interested, he will answer from his own perspective, and the questioner may not have gained anything. However, for those who do not want to think or do their homework before asking a question, the respondent is not willing to spend more time on interpretation, so they will ignore it. They don’t want to waste time dealing with such problems and miss more noteworthy questions or people worthy of answering.
 	
The arguments in this article can be widely used in various fields, as long as the technical words are removed, they are basically the same. Ask the right question is a kind of politeness, more or less we must respect the time and energy that the experts spent on us. For people who simply want to ask for answers without thinking or searching for information, they basically have no obligation to help you. Enthusiasm is limited, its limit is the same as human beings only have 24 hours a day. In order to keep the mood happy, they will mostly choose to ignore some problems immediately.
